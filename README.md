# BeyondCompare_PentahoConverter
Converter to convert pentaho files (ktr, kjb) to human readable for easier comparision

# Requirements
python 3.x

# Setup
Install the fileformat package
Copy the python script to a folder (default C:\tools). If you do not use the default folder, change the settings in beyond compare to direct to the correct path.
Be happy!

# Info
File format is defined as read only, because the converted format should not be saved. It will break your kjb, ktr.  So for editing you should switch to a normal xml comparision (and maybe temporary disable the pentaho file format in Beyond Compare).
